# Assignment-5 Data Structures and Strings in Python

## Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
Here I have used dictionary get method to solve the problem.
But there is one thing dictionary key is case sensitive so if any one write Alice,
then only the values gets returned but if anyone writes alice then that will return student not found.
So my code exactly omit this problem by keeping the key in lower case. and also while taking the user input taking that in lower case.

## Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing 
List slicing done and  proving expected output.
